This thesis details the design, testing, calibration, and verification of a nine degree of freedom inertial measurement data logger for use with floating bodies.
The instrument was conceived to address limitations of equipment used in classes within the Ocean Engineering department at Florida Institute of Technology.
By meeting with several stakeholders and end users, a series of stakeholder requirements, capabilities, and component-level requirements were developed that informed the design constraints.
There were several hardware iterations of the board, culminating in Revision F5 which was extensively tested and proven.
The design was inspected after testing concluded to determine which capabilities or requirements were met and detail additional efforts for future students.
Overall, the design was successful and promises to be a compelling instrument for use in class and laboratory environments.
With some additional work, it may become more equivalent to some of its commercial counterparts.
