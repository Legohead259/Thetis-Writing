\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}
We all view the world through different lenses.
Biologists look at plants and animals and seeks to understand their interactions;
similarly, a scientist considers the universe around us and ponders what drives and constrains it;
a psychologist examines human behavior and analyzes its origin and meaning.
Humanity has always tried to study the way things work and figure out why they happen.
That is the natural product of our curiosity and one of the many things that distinguishes us from other animals.

The fundamental problem that is considered throughout this thesis is sensing the inertial characteristics of a body and determining its orientation.
The solutions to this problem are not new.
It has been well-studied, well-documented, thoroughly proven out, and is even available to the masses at every moment of every day - even though they may not be aware they are using it.
The purpose of the content herewithin is not to unveil something new or revolutionary.
Rather it is the culmination of years of viewing this problem through the engineer's lense and pondering the questions, "how does this work?" and "how can I make it work for me?"
This is a guide into how an engineer can look at a problem and tinker with it and research it and develop something for it that enhances their understanding.
While the final product may not be itself an innovation, the skills and knowledge required to get there can always lead to greater things.

\section{Objectives}
Based on the questions posed above, I set out to design an all-in-one, low-cost, open source inertial and positional data logger that could be used by students in their projects.
The data logger will be able to replace instruments used in some classes that were not appropriate for the applications they were used for, and to make some experiments in laboratory sections easier for students to analyze.
Additionally, the device will be cheap and easy to reproduce, making it highly-attritible for students that will inevitably break the device during testing.
Its open-source nature will also allow endeavoring students to expand the device's capabilities in both hardware and software as research projects or interests demand.

\section{Hypothesis}
The hypothesis considered for this thesis is that multiple tri-axial sensors could be integrated with a global positioning system radio and a WiFi-capable microcontroller to create a low-cost data logger that is on par with more expensive, state of the art solutions, while adding additional capabilities for students and being more attritible than said solutions.
