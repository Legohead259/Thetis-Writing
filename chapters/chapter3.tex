\section{Stakeholders} \label{sec:stakeholders}
As with any project, stakeholders are a crucial part of the design process.
Stakeholders drive certain requirements that the device must achieve in order to be accepted for operation.
On an individual level, the committee overseeing this thesis are the major stakeholders as they have a vested interest in the success or failure of the project.
However, there are some organizational-level stakeholders that have also expressed interest in the project and provided some feedback for their requirements.
A summary of the stakeholders is provided in Table \ref{tab:stakeholders}.

		Committee members & Individual professors who have expressed interest in the project and have agreed to assist in its development. Specifically, Dr. Wood and Dr. Weaver would like to deploy Thetis on university projects; Dr. Gutierrez has provided many requirements on the performance of the instrumentation; and Dr. Silaghi is interested in its application to autonomous navigation. \\
		\hline
		Florida Institute of \newline Technology & The university has several classes and projects where the Thetis design could be useful. The Instrumentation Design and Analysis class used Thetis as a demonstrator for designing PCBs and field experiments. Thetis was also designed with Surf Engineering Analysis in mind for students to have a new open source sensor to experiment with. \\

\subsection{Hands-On Users} \label{ssec:hands_on_users}

\section{Design Rationale} \label{sec:design_rationale}
Thetis is envisioned as an open-source all-in-one data logging solution for use in research projects.
The device incorporates multiple sensors, GPS tracking, and a WiFi-capable microcontroller in order to enable as many features as can be envisioned by the end users.
One of the driving considerations was the small footprint.
Thetis Revision F is designed to fit into one of the smallest IP67-rated enclosures available on the market [LINK].  
This tiny form factor allows it to be inconspicuously mounted to any floating body like surfboards, scale models, or wave buoys without upsetting their inertial characteristics or impeding nominal operation.

Further discussions with stakeholders later in the design process envisioned a new iteration, Revision G, that had a larger footprint, but added more capabilities like CANbus integration and several connection ports for different communication protocols.
This revision is meant for deployment on vessels that have a NMEA2000 communications bus.
This bus allows the device to be powered from the boat's power supply and communicate data to a central controller.
These features are extremely important for the final application where Thetis is meant to feed data into a navigation algorithm for the safe passage of unmanned vessels.

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{ssec:problem_desc}
Tracking the inertial movements of small floating bodies in-situ is difficult for small-scale or student-led experiments.
The price of the measurement instruments and the data acquisition computers (DAQs) offers a high bar for entry for these projects.
Also, the size of these instruments and DAQs can negatively impact the performance or operation of small floating bodies so they cannot be effectively used.
This forces classrooms and organizations to either neglect collecting inertial data or using bulky, unreliable prototype setups using off-the-shelf components

\subsection{Mission Statement} \label{ssec:mission_statement}
Thetis aims to democratize the inertial measurement and tracking space for small scale experiments by implementing an open-source, feature-rich, all-in-one solution to monitoring the movements of floating bodies.

\subsection{Stakeholder Requirements} \label{ssec:stakeholder_reqs}
Interviews with the stakeholders occurred over several months and informed a set of requirements that they determined were necessary for the project's success.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{SR 01}] - The system shall be able to record acceleration, rotation rate, orientation, and position
	\item[\textbf{SR 02}] - The system shall be able to fit into a small IP67-rated, or better, enclosure
	\item[\textbf{SR 03}] - The system shall be able to fit into a small IP67-rated, or better, enclosure
	\item[\textbf{SR 04}] - The system shall be cheaper than \$200 per unit
	\item[\textbf{SR 05}] - The system shall use components that are readily available COTS
	\item[\textbf{SR 06}] - The system designs shall be open source for modification by students
	\item[\textbf{SR 07}] - The system shall communicate intra-device using known IEEE standards (e.g. SPI/I2C/UART/etc)
	\item[\textbf{SR 08}] - The system shall communicate extra-device using WiFi and USB
	\item[\textbf{SR 09}] - They system shall have enough on-board storage for 4 hours of continuously logging at 64 Hz
	\item[\textbf{SR 10}] - Thetis Revision G shall be able to communicate extra-device using CANbus
	\item[\textbf{SR 11}] - The system shall have redundant storage for device and communication events
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Risk Identification} \label{ssec:risk_identification}
The following tables explore some of the larger risks associated with each of the stakeholder requirements.
Risks are categorized into several types: Technical, Cost, Schedule, Organizational, and Operational.
Each risk has an associated consequence on the project's development and a severity rating from "Low" to "High".
With every risk, we can apply a mitigation to it to reduce the severity of the consequence.

\paragraph*{Technical Risks} These are risks that pose a technical challenge to the project such as sensor accuracies, programming difficulty, or component specifications. 
These risks are likely to impede the development of Thetis by showing up during testing and forcing workarounds after the fact, rather than before.

\paragraph*{Cost Risks} These risks pose a threat to Thetis's development budget.
They are more likely to manifest in the supply chain of Thetis, especially in the after effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the chaos of the chip shortage.
More often, mitigating these risks requires some careful planning and a larger budget and will typically not impede the development process.

\paragraph*{Schedule Risks} By delaying the program's development, Schedule Risks are the most notorious and costly of them all.
These risks manifest as delays in development or the supply chain and can significantly impact the expected delivery time of the device.
They also are prominent across all phases of the design process from planning to testing and are only mitigated, but never eliminated during the design spiral.

\paragraph*{Organization Risks} The stakeholders represent various organizations that have an interest in Thetis.
This risk type poses a problem for the specific stakeholder organization and their interests.
This can be viewed from the political, economical, or schedule points of view as these are important considerations for the stakeholders.

\paragraph*{Operational Risks} These risks challenge end users of the device while they are testing.
Most of them can be mitigated in the design process by working directly with the end users and ensuring their concerns are met.
However, the majority of them will only manifest during testing and must be mitigated after the fact.
This could mean substantial cost increases and schedule delays depending on the severity of the risk.

\subsection{Quality Functional Deployment} \label{ssec:qfd}
In engineering, there are a variety of customers that need to have their needs met.
These customers can be internal or external to the project and most were described in Section \ref{sec:stakeholders}.
To ensure that Thetis is designed with the stakeholders in mind, a Quality Functional Deployment (QFD) was performed.
A QFD weighs the stakeholder requirements (the "whats") with the "hows", or engineering methods in a weighted design matrix shown below.
The QFD analysis is designed to inform engineers what the highest priority methods are based on customer feedback.
This gives stakeholders a "voice" in the design in a compact matrix format.

\subsubsection{House of Quality} \label{sssec:hoq}
The House of Quality (HOQ) is the product generated by a QFD analysis.
The left side of the matrix defines the customer desires with an associated weight or priority for each.
This data is collected by canvassing the stakeholders and getting their feedback on their priorities.

The middle of the matrix is dedicated with the engineering methods.
Here, the design engineers add the methods they think are required to fulfill the projects requirements.
The numbers throughout the matrix are the strength of the relationship between the requirement and method. 
The scale is the Fibonacci sequence from 0-8 with higher numbers indicating a stronger relationship.
For example, SR-03 has a middling relationship with most of the engineering methods and a very strong (8) relationship with the "Battery Capacity" method.
However, it does not correlate at all (0) with the storage capacity method.

The "roof" or top of the matrix is the inter-relationship between the different engineering methods.
The grading is slightly different with "-", "0", "+" indicating a detrimental, non-existent, or positive relation with multiple of each denoting the strength.
As an example, the cost of Thetis has varying degrees of negative association with each of the other engineering methods.
The type of IMU, GPS, storage method, battery capacity, and enclosure size all add cost to the project and therefore are detrimental to this method.

The right side of the matrix is part of the competitive analysis where Thetis is compared with the other products in use by stakeholders.
Each product is rated on a 1-5 scale of increasing quality for each stakeholder requirement.
This rating is produced based on their capabilities and performance as determined by the stakeholders.
From the matrix, we can see that Thetis has a strong overall rating with regard to all the requirements where the Lowell MAT-1 struggles with the cost and measurement requirements and the iPhone is strong overall except its price and access for students.

At the bottom of the matrix is the technical performance analysis.
The first two rows rate each engineering method with an importance which is described by Equation \ref{eq:hoq_importance} and \ref{eq:hoq_rel_importance}.
The importance of each method informs the design engineers what they should be focussing on during development and what is most important to the stakeholders.
Beneath that is a technical comparison of Thetis and competing products across the engineering methods.
This provides a quick breakdown of each product through the lense of the engineering methods, providing some insight to stakeholders of the benefit of Thetis over competitors.

\begin{gather}
	\label{eq:hoq_importance}
	I = \sum_{n=1}^N{w_n \times R_n} \\
	\begin{aligned}
		\text{where } &I \text{ is the engineering method's importance} \\
					  &N \text{ is the number of stakeholder requirements} \\
					  &w_n \text{ is the weight of a stakeholder requirement, } n \\
					  &R_n \text{ is the strength of the relationship between the requirement and method}
	\end{aligned} \notag
\end{gather}

\begin{gather}
	\label{eq:hoq_rel_importance}
	RI = \frac{I_m}{\sum{\textbf{I}}} \\
	\begin{aligned}
		\text{where } &RI \text{ is the engineering method's relative importance} \\
					  &I_m \text{ is the current method's importance} \\
					  &\textbf{I} \text{ is the vector of all the method's importance} \\
	\end{aligned} \notag
\end{gather}

\section{Concept of Operations} \label{sec:conops}
Thetis is envisioned to be an all-in-one data logging solution that can provide real-time calculations of vessel orientation and position in real-time at a low cost.
In a normal operating case, Thetis will be placed near the center of gravity of a floating vessel and turned on to begin recording.
The user can then connect Thetis to the ship network or use its local WiFi access point to monitor the system and adjust configuration settings.
These configuration settings include different modes that change how Thetis behaves and what data it records.

\paragraph*{9DOF AHRS Mode} When placed into the 9DOF AHRS mode, Thetis will record the vessel acceleration, rotation rate, magnetic heading, and attitude at a set interval according to the user.
This mode is the most verbose recording method and can provide a lot of information on how the vessel is reacting to the current sea conditions. 
Users can specify if they want to record the filtered and fused data as well as the raw data from the sensors.
This option gives them the ability to run their own analysis in post using different software filtering techniques that may increase accuracy relative to what Thetis could achieve in-situ.

\paragraph*{9DOF INS Mode} When placed into the 9DOF INS mode, Thetis incorporates the built-in GPS to its recording functionality.
The GPS module provides real-time position, velocity, course, and error at up to 10 Hz.
This provides a more accurate estimate of the vessel's current position and how it changes over time.
This mode can also provide basic waypoint navigation services to an automated controller for low-cost basic autonomy applications.
Thetis Revision G is specifically designed for this application as its dual independent CAN busses can transmit data to a central controller over the NMEA2000 protocol, making it easier to integrate with unmanned vessels or manned vessels with electronic helms.

\paragraph*{WEAVE Mode} The Wave Estimator Algorithm for VEssels (WEAVE) mode is a special mode that allows Thetis to predict the wave heights encountered by the vessel in real-time.
The algorithm is explained more in depth in Section \ref{sec:weave}.
This mode allows Thetis to communicate the estimated current sea conditions to a central controller or operator so that they make the appropriate decisions with the operation of the vessel.
The biggest application of this algorithm in the unmanned technology sector where the unmanned vessel can integrate these estimates into its world model and make better decisions about the best course and speed it should pursue.
Again, the inclusion of dual independent CAN busses on Revision G makes this feature easier to integrate on electronically-driven vessels.

\section{Conceptual Design} \label{sec:conceptual_design}
The general design of the Thetis instrumentation package was built around the principles of capability, manufacturability, and affordability.
The parts selected for the design had to offer a suite of capabilities that would enable a wide range of projects.
While Thetis was designed primarily for monitoring the movement of floating bodies, it can be adapted for use in general robotics, embedded AI research, and other datalogging tasks.
Thetis is also envisioned to be continued by other endeavoring students, so it has to be easily manufacturable with a single-sided design that can be assembled by hand using tweezers and a hot-air gun.
All of this had to be designed with low-cost readily-available components in mind.
Thetis was originally designed at the start of the global chip shortage in 2020, so parts were limited in choice, especially the IMU.
It is also assumed that Thetis will be lost at some point during testing.
This is just an inevitability during field work, so keeping the cost down would also reduce the impact of such a loss on a project's budget.

\subsection{Functional Block Diagram} \label{ssec:block_diagram}
Factoring in the design principles of capability, manufacturability, and affordability, along with the stakeholder requirements listed in Section \ref{ssec:stakeholder_reqs}, a block diagram was constructed that integrated the crucial parts and drew out their interactions.
This block diagram shows the data sharing relationships in blue and the power relationships in warm colors.
Labels on the specific lines indicate the specific communication protocol or voltage level being used by the line.
Explanations for these protocols and acronyms can be found in the Appendix.

	\includegraphics[width=5in]{design/block_diagram.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Functional Flow Diagram} \label{ssec:flow_diagram}
Based off the block diagram and interviews with potential end users, a notional flow diagram for the firmware was created.
The code was designed to be modular and allow for new features to be quickly added or removed with separate libraries.
Additionally, any functions that need to be called, can be executed at specific times to increase computational efficiency and reduce the chance of race conditions occurring.
Note that this block diagram only includes the base firmware.
Breakdowns for the algorithmic flows for different operating modes will be given in their respective sections.

	\includegraphics[width=5in]{design/flow_diagram.png}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Failure Mode, Effect, and Criticality Analysis} \label{ssec:fmeca}
Since Thetis is intended to be used by end users who may not have a solid background in programming or electrical skills, it is important to identify potential flaws in the design and attempt to mitigate them.
Each potential flaw is given a weighting from 0 to 1 inclusive for both the probability that they will occur, as well as the failure severity if they do. By multiplying these two values together, a Risk Priority Number (RPN) is created that highlights the severity of a potential failure mode. The RPNs are categorized into three groupings:

\paragraph*{LOW} These are RPNs with a value below 0.25 and represent little risk to the system. 
These are denoted with green highlights in the FMECA chart below.

\paragraph*{MEDIUM} These are RPN's between 0.25 and 0.5 that are represented with yellow highlights below.
Typically, these failure modes represent a noticeable threat to the system and the mitigations should be carefully implemented.

\paragraph*{HIGH} These are the highest risk RPNs between 0.5 and 1 and are represented with red highlights.
They are the most severe and should be mitigated at all cost during and after the product development cycle.

The probabilities are generally conjured from past experience, the failure ratings of parts, and other factors that are carefully mapped out and documented over time.
However, since Thetis is using hobby-grade materials and failures are not generally well-documented for the parts, the probabilities represented herein are the best guess of the author based of his experience and best guess.
The same applies for the criticality score for each potential failure.
